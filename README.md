A collection of repos containing various algorithms visualized in different means:
- Minimax w/ alpha-beta pruning implemented in Connect 4
- Pathfinding algos (DFS, BFS, Djikstras, A*) and Maze generation (Recursive divison and DFS Backtracking) algos implemented in a maze application
- Recursive backtracking implemented in sudoku
